### Introduction.
I am currently studying at The University of Nairobi going to my fourth year.For the past three years "_it has been tough_" but not exactly.I would say having been that pressured in highschool and studying under supervision the first year was "**A STRUGGLE**".I eventually got thee hang of it and managed to manoeuvre through it.My school is aesthetic,[University of Nairobi](https://images.app.goo.gl/xegNP1d7NDjfrmsZ8) I love it there so far.I am looking forward to graduating though i can't wait!
